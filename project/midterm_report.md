## Midterm Report

### Goals:

- Literature review
- A clear plan

### To Do:

- Project Proposal
- Suggested length: 3 pages (not a hard requirement, just a guideline)

### Suggested structure of the report:

1. What is the hypothesis? Or What is the question the project focuses on?
2. Literature review. How have researchers addressed this question before?
3. Why is this question important? Discuss the project in the context of 5-10 relevant papers read.
4. A Break down of project into steps. Explain what **experiments** we will be
running. A diagram, flowchart, or list of intermediate aims, is great here.
5. What are the 1-2 key papers that we will be relying on?
6. Any foreseen challenges or stumbling blocks? How do we plan to address them?

### Parts of Each Experiments: 

For each experiment:

1. **Dataset**: What dataset(s) will be used? Is it public? Do we have the dataset? If not, how are we going to get access / prepare the dataset?
2. **Model**:  What models to be used? What is the plan on how to train the models? Will we be building on code from GitHub? What code base to be used?
3. **Results Measurements**: How to measure our results? What evaluation metric(s) will we use? Are these metrics standard? Do we have code for them or how are we planning to implement them? What are relevant benchmarks?
  - What constitutes success in this project?
  - How would we interpret the results?
4. Do we have enough data? 
5. What's expected computational resources? 


### Preliminary progress

- What's current progress so far?
- Are there any formatting issues with the dataset? Do we have enough data?
- Will we have enough computational resources?
- What have we trained so far?
- What are the preliminary results?
- What are the next immediate steps?
