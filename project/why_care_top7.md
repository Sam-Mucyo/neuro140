### **Project 1: Building models that generalize well**  
**Why it’s important:**  
- Neural networks struggle with real-world generalization.  
- Performance in controlled datasets doesn’t translate well to unseen conditions.  

**What’s at stake:**  
- AI systems that fail in critical applications (self-driving cars, medical AI, security systems).  
- Biases and overfitting can lead to harmful real-world consequences.  

**Impact:**  
- More robust AI models that can function reliably across different domains.  
- Safer AI applications in healthcare, security, and autonomous systems.

### **Project 4: Impact of changing Transition Function in Deep RL**  
**Why it’s important:**  
- RL models often fail when the environment changes slightly.  

**What’s at stake:**  
- If reinforcement learning agents can’t handle unexpected changes, they won’t be reliable for real-world applications (robotics, financial trading, gaming AI).  

**Impact:**  
- Leads to better adaptive AI systems.  
- Improves trust in RL models for real-world automation.

### **Project 12: Structurally focused topic modeling**  
**Why it’s important:**  
- Extracting structured insights from unstructured data is a major challenge.  

**What’s at stake:**  
- Without structured analysis, valuable insights from large text datasets are lost.  

**Impact:**  
- Can be used for educational insights, misinformation detection, and scientific research.

### **Project 13: Lifelong learning with latent replay in transformers**  
**Why it’s important:**  
- AI struggles with learning multiple tasks sequentially without forgetting previous ones.  

**What’s at stake:**  
- AI models need to be retrained from scratch whenever new tasks arise.  

**Impact:**  
- Leads to AI that can continuously learn like humans.  
- Enables better AI assistants, adaptive robotics, and personalized learning systems.

### **Project 14: Neural networks as models of learners**  
**Why it’s important:**  
- AI that mimics human learning could revolutionize education and personalized learning.  

**What’s at stake:**  
- AI tutors and adaptive learning systems are currently unreliable and rigid.  

**Impact:**  
- AI that personalizes learning experiences based on student behavior and knowledge gaps.  

---

### **Project 15: Effortful retrieval hypothesis in AI**  
**Why it’s important:**  
- Memory consolidation is a key aspect of human intelligence.  

**What’s at stake:**  
- AI that doesn’t strengthen forgotten information could be less efficient in long-term learning.  

**Impact:**  
- Could lead to AI that learns more efficiently over time.  
- Might improve AI for education and tutoring systems.

### **Project 16: Detect disease in chest X-rays**  
**Why it’s important:**  
- AI-powered medical diagnosis is promising but unreliable across different populations.  

**What’s at stake:**  
- Models trained on one population may not work well for others, leading to misdiagnoses.  

**Impact:**  
- More reliable and fair medical AI, improving global healthcare.
